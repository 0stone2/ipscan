Before 3.0 beta:

* export/import of settings (profiles?)
* NetBIOS fetchers (like in 2.x)

Before 3.0:

* command-line scanning start
* tools->delete menus (maybe tools->select?)
* fetcher-specific options
* multiple port support web-detect
* add new fetchers by configuration of PortTextFetcher
* startup as root option
* compile librocksaw for mac
* preferences & select fetchers buttons in the toolbar

Later:

* preferences profiles (maybe even save with favorites)
* offer installation on Windows
* free text (advanced) feeder
* comments fetcher
* saving and restoring of results together with all options
* plugin loader
* advanced find (firefox-like)
* use jpcap for raw packet injection and ARP scanning
