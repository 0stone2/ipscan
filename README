Written by Anton Keks, GPL v2 license

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The source code is in the Subversion repository:
https://ipscan.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ipscan/trunk/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under the `trunk' directory you will find the following Eclipse projects:

* ipscan          - the main source tree of Angry IP Scanner (uses Java 1.4)
* ipscan-unittest - the unittests of the main tree (uses Java 1.5)
* swt             - the version of Eclipse SWT currently in use (GUI toolkit)

All the directories have preconfigured Eclipse projects in them, so before
doing a checkout:

* Ensure you have Subclipse installed: http://subclipse.tigris.org/
* Create a new Eclipse workspace
* Choose File->New->Project
* Choose SVN->Checkout projects from SVN
* Repeat the last 2 steps to check all the 3 projects out

Under `ipscan' and `ipscan-unittest' you will find subdirectories:

* ext       - external libraries used (some with source and other files)
* src       - main Java sources
* test      - unittest Java sources
* resources - resources to be put into the jar file

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build Angry IP Scanner, use ant:
cd ipscan
ant all

This will leave jar files in the `dist' directory.

Then, to run:
./ipscan.sh
