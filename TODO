Before 3.0:

* top-level exception handler for NoClassDefFoundErrors, etc
* command-line scanning start
* fetcher-specific options
* multiple port support web-detect
* add new fetchers by configuration of PortTextFetcher
* startup as root option
* compile librocksaw for mac
* plugin loader
* export/import of settings (profiles?)

Later:

* preferences profiles (tied to favorites?)
* offer installation on Windows
* free text (advanced) feeder
* saving and restoring of results together with all options
* advanced find (firefox-like)
* use jpcap for raw packet injection and ARP scanning
