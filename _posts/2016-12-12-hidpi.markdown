Angry IP Scanner now proudly supports HiDPI/Retina screens on Windows and Linux
starting with version *3.5* released today.

Mac OS X retina support was already available before.

This works thanks to an update in SWT (the GUI toolkit) to version *4.7M3*, which in addition to
scaled fonts now also scales images as well. Also, HiDPI versions of all icons was
also provided, updating most of the icons to a flatter style.

Support for running with **Java 6** is also now dropped, so that the last version
compatible with Java 6 is *3.4.2*. According to the statistics, there are a
very few users still running Java 6. All of them are recommended to upgrade 
their Java.

Running on **Windows XP** is no longer officially supported, however it may still work.
Angry IP Scanner now uses some Unicode characters in the UI that may not be
rendered correctly by this version of Windows.
