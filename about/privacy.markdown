Your privacy is important to us. This page describes the privacy policy applicable to the services using the [angryip.org]({{ site.url }}) domain (the website) as well as the Angry IP Scanner (the software).

We do not record any personally identifiable information without your prior, explicit consent.

Some services on the website allow you to register an account, requiring you to enter your name and your e-mail address in addition to a username of your choice upon account creation. All actions made using your account may be logged. Your account profile, as well as all texts and images posted using your account are publicly visible. Retention is potentially unlimited unless removal of your content is required by law.

The software may contact the website to query the latest version of the software, however it is triggered manually through the menu and doesn't happen automatically. No data about your computer or yourself is available to the server apart from the IP address. This data is not being shared with any third party.
