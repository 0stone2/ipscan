The GitHub project has been moved to its own organization, [angryip](https://github.com/angryip).

All download and development URLs have been moved accordingly. Fortunately,
GitHub will redirect old URLs to new ones automatically for the foreseeable future.

Anyway, it is wise to update your git urls, by e.g:

```
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/angryip/ipscan
```

The move is to facilitate more contributors to join the project.
