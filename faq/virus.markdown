================

_Important:_ There are no trojans or viruses in Angry IP Scanner's _ipscan.exe_. Review the [source code](http://github.com/angryip/ipscan/tree/ipscan2) if you wish to check yourself.

Some antivirus software vendors (McAfee, Symantec, and some others) are identifying Angry IP Scanner as 'potentially unwanted program' or risky 'hacktool'.
Their programs often delete Angry IP Scanner from the disk during virus scanning.

The reason behind this is the will to bloat 'virus databases' and show unreal high number of detected 'viruses' in order to impress their customers.
So they include everything they can find on the Internet, including many security tools, such as Angry IP Scanner.

Note that the cross-platform incarnation of Angry IP Scanner (version _3.x_) is not being detected.

There is a _petition_ to antivirus software vendors, please [sign it](http://www.petitiononline.com/angryip/petition.html).

Here is [a discussion](http://forum.avira.com/thread.php?postid=193971) on the topic.
